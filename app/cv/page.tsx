                  Ticket To Ride, before becoming Lead on the project in November. I led a team of 4-6 developers from
                  the initial PC/Mac launch and on through to Mobile, Nintendo Switch, Xbox and Playstation versions,
                  and 10 DLC expansions. The game features real-time and asynchronous multiplayer, with a competitive
                  tiered leaderboard system.

                    Another Mosaic puzzle game focusing on Ancient Egypt. This was a slight shadow drop on steam, so it
                    hasn't performed as well as the other titles yet, but I'm optimistic that it will do well in the
                    longer term.

                    game was extremely well received by players, maintaining a 100% positive review score up to around
                    250 reviews/3 months after launch.

                    Mega Mosaic is a meditative puzzle game where players slowly solve an enormous minesweeper-like
                    puzzle. As players complete different regions of the puzzle, they're rewarded with pixel art
                    illustrations that reveal themselves, as well as earning nearly 100 achievements for various
                    challenges.

                    Logic Town is a cute and casual logic puzzle game. Players journey through 12 different themed areas
                    of a seaside town meeting different animal characters that live there. They'll solve challenging
                    Logic Puzzles, and get to redecorate dioramas of different shops and venues in the town that are in
                    need of repair. Since its launch I've designed and published 3 DLC expansions, and the game is about
                    to receive an update adding Daily Challenge Mode.

                    favourite. Players compete against up to 3 opponents in each match, where they can emote and chat
                    and show off their newly earned characters, while playing the game. As players win and earn
                    trophies, they'll work their way up a series of tiered leagues, with higher stakes and greater
                    rewards, as well as new rule variations that keep players.
